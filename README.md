# Honeypot Deployment — Internet-Facing Attack Intelligence Platform

> **Internet-facing SSH/Telnet/HTTP/SMB honeypot capturing real attacker behavior from global threat actors.**
> Deployed on DigitalOcean NYC1. Logs forwarded via encrypted WireGuard tunnel to on-premises Ubuntu Server.
> Part 3 of a 4-project cybersecurity portfolio leading into Carnegie Mellon University's MSISPM program.

## Honeypot Stack

| Service | Container | Ports | Captures |
|---------|-----------|-------|----------|
| Cowrie | `cowrie/cowrie:latest` | 22, 23 | SSH/Telnet credentials, full session transcripts, commands, file transfers |
| nginx | `nginx:alpine` | 80, 443 | Web scanner requests, CVE probes, path traversal, Log4Shell attempts |
| Dionaea | `dinotools/dionaea` | 21, 445, 1433, 3306 | Malware binaries, SMB exploits, FTP uploads, database credential attempts |

---

## Data Pipeline

```
Cowrie/nginx/Dionaea logs
         │
         │ rsync every 15 minutes
         │ via WireGuard tunnel (encrypted)
         ▼
Ubuntu Server /opt/cowrie-logs/
         │
         │ GeoIP enrichment (hourly cron)
         │ MaxMind GeoLite2-City + GeoLite2-ASN
         ▼
cowrie_enriched.json
(src_country, src_city, src_asn, src_org added to every event)
         │
         │ export_to_wazuh.py (Project 4 handoff)
         ▼
Wazuh SIEM ingestion
```

## Analysis Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `analysis/analyze_sessions.py` | Credential analysis, command frequency, tool fingerprinting, geographic breakdown (reads GeoIP-enriched Cowrie JSON) |
| `analysis/explain_sessions.py` | LLM-powered session transcript explanations via Ollama llama3.1:8b |
| `pipeline/enrich_logs.py` | GeoIP enrichment — adds country/city/ASN to every event |
| `pipeline/export_to_wazuh.py` | Transforms Cowrie JSON to Wazuh-ingestible format for Project 4 |

> Note: the headline dataset (11.6M events) was queried from the OpenSearch/Wazuh index, which held the complete capture; the flat enriched-JSON files synced via rsync were partial due to a log-rotation gap. See docs/09-lessons-learned.md (Lessons 7–8).

## Portfolio Context

This is Project 3 of a 4-project cybersecurity portfolio:

| Project | Repository | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| 1 — Home Lab Infrastructure | [home-lab-infrastructure](https://github.com/tyceerickson/home-lab-infrastructure) | ✅ Complete |
| 2 — AI Network Traffic Classifier | [ai-traffic-classifier](https://github.com/tyceerickson/ai-traffic-classifier) | ✅ Complete |
